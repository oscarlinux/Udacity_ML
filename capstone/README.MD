# Sotavento's Wind Energy Power Forecasting
In this project, I am proposing a seq2seq approach using a encoder-decoder LSTM network to forecast wind power production for a short term (8 hours ahead) for the [Sotavento’s wind farm](http://www.sotaventogalicia.com/en/real-time-data/instantaneous-wind-farm) in Galicia, Spain.

The implementation of this project was highly inspired by Dr. Jason Brownlee in his tutorial [‘How To Develop LSTM Models for Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting of Households Power Consumption’](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-multi-step-time-series-forecasting-of-household-power-consumption/) and parts of the ideas and code used in this projects were taken from his tutorial.
